# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project uses **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural networks to predict stock prices based on historical data. It fetches data from **Kaagle**, preprocesses it, trains an LSTM model, and visualizes actual vs predicted prices.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Fetches stock data  
- Preprocesses data (normalization, sequence creation)  
- Builds and trains an **LSTM model**  
- Predicts and plots **actual vs predicted stock prices**  
- Estimates **future 30-day stock prices**
